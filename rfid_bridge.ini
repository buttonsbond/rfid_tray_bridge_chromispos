# RFID POS Bridge configuration.
# prefix: digits/letters added before the UID (magstripe PAN prefix, etc.).
#   Note: Chromis documentation suggests “M1995”, but Chromis only accepts digits.
#         The default below uses “1995” so the cards are recognized.
# suffix: trailing characters (default '?' for magstripe). Leave blank if not needed.
# send_semicolon: set to "yes" to prepend ';' (Track-2 start). Chromis prefers "no".
# send_enter: set to "yes" to press Enter after typing. Chromis requires this.
# typing_interval: delay between keystrokes (seconds). Increase if your POS needs slower typing.
# chromis_mode: when "yes", overrides the above to match Chromis (no ';', send Enter).
