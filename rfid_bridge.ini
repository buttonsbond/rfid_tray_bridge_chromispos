# RFID POS Bridge configuration.
# prefix: digits/letters added before the UID (e.g., merchant ID or magstripe PAN prefix).
#    Note: Chromis documentation suggests “M1995”, but Chromis only accepts digits;
#          the default below uses “1995” so the card is recognized.
# suffix: trailing characters (default '?' for magstripe sentinel). Leave blank if not needed.
# send_semicolon: set to "yes" to prepend ';' (magstripe Track-2 start). Chromis prefers "no".
# send_enter: set to "yes" to press Enter after the code. Chromis requires this.
# typing_interval: delay between keystrokes (seconds). Increase if your POS needs slower typing.
# chromis_mode: when "yes", overrides the above to match Chromis expectations (no ';', send Enter).
