# RFID POS Bridge configuration.
# prefix = digits/letters added before the UID (magstripe PAN prefix, etc.).
#   Note: Chromis docs mention "M1995", but Chromis only accepts digits.
#         The default below uses "1995" so cards are recognized.
# suffix = trailing characters after UID (ignored if send_suffix is no).
# send_suffix: yes/no – append suffix if true
# send_semicolon = yes/no (prepend semicolon). Chromis may prefer no semicolon.
# send_enter = yes/no (press Enter after typing).
# typing_interval = delay between keystrokes (seconds). Increase if POS needs slower typing.
# chromis_mode = yes/no (Chromis mode disables semicolon and enforces Enter)
# logging_enabled = yes/no
# log_file = log filename
# startup_delay = seconds to wait for reader after login
# nfc_tag_mode = yes/no (enable NFC tag mode)
